<sub>Instagram Feeds View</sub>
-
* It is just a demo view to show feeds as shown in Instagram.
* In this demo UITableview used with Multiple cells.
* All description of post(Image,User,Like,Comment etc..) can be managed by the array of an post.
* All actions and updations of cell are manged by blocks so no need to update cell by using Tableview Refresh delegate.
* While updating sections it scrolls ups/Down but by using blocks nothing happen and updations can be done smoothly.
* suggestions are always welcome.

<sub>Output will come like this</sub>

| Potrait View    | Landscape View|
